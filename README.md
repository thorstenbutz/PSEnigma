# PSEnigma
PowerShell implementation for the Enigma cipher machine

This is just a draft for demoing purposes. 
A PowerShell module will be available "soon".

## Codebreaker contest
Dear codebreakers, today there is something to win: Can you decode an Enigma message? 
I got a price for you! We have intercepted a message: 

    WKYKX MTXAN BFUFD DBTIL YYRQW
    OZKCT DTZCS SUNNS HATWO OXZOG
    KGGON UIFUG WJSAU ACSYI SYBAD
    KBBIF UKHFL

We own the so-called "Maschinenschl√ºssel" (the daily setup), we only miss the 3 letters "message_key" :

    (2, (3,1,2), '???', (21,6,23), 'AB KI CD EF GH XY VW JL MP QZ')

Can you read the message? Chances are, that we find the 3 letters soon ...
You will have to change the **'???'** with the correct 3 letters.
If you know the answer, send me a DM, Email. The first three codebreakers will receive a price.
